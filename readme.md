# Personal Website

Welcome to the repository of my personal website! My name is Ben Wills and I am an aspiring programmer who also has a passion for teaching. I would like to use this website of a means of sharing what I find interesting as well as advertising my skills to the broader word... as well as giving web design a go using ReactJS!

The end goal is to host this website on `AWS` and have it be publically accessable to the masses ðŸ¤“, until then I'll settle for a lowly docker container!
